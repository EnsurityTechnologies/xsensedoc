ThinC-AUTH Bio Pro is a USB based security key that can be used for Windows smart card logon eliminating the need for a separate card reader.

A more secure method of authentication than a standard password logon can be obtained by smart cards. Using a smart card to sign in to a Windows domain account, the operating system uses X.509v3 certificates and Kerberos v5 authentication.

The user must input the card PIN during Windows sign in using ThinC-AUTH Bio Pro security key. ThinC-AUTH Bio Pro security key stores the user's digital identity and this PIN together create a two-factor authentication system.
