## Standalone Mode

If the device is in standalone mode, then the users can use the **<a href="https://www.ensurity.com/Products/ThinC_AUTH#Resources"> ThinC-AUTH tool</a>** for fingerprint or use Microsoft Windows default tool available in Windows Settings. The complete process on the fingerprint enrollment using the ThinC-AUTH tool is available **<a href="https://thinc.ensurity.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/manuals/ThinC-AUTH_Microsoft/ThinC-AUTHIntroduction.html"> ThinC-AUTH User Manual</a>**

## Corporate Mode

The **ThinC Manager Tool** is a standalone application, which helps the end-users to enroll their Fingerprints on to their assigned ThinC-AUTH biometric security key. A corporate license will be integrated within the ThinC-AUTH Keys to facilitate the AMS compatibility, which enable complete life-cycle management of FIDO2 Security Keys.

The ThinC Manager securely communicates with the AMS module of the XSense IdP Server for validating the assigned number of fingerprints to be enrolled by the designed users. 

- The Tool is required for enrolling user's fingerprints on the assigned Biometric FIDO2 Security Keys.
- User needs to securely login to the Agent Tool with one-time-pass-code that is generated by the XSense IdP Server.
- The Tool can be pushed to the end-user system through Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), or can be downloaded from the enterprise portal - a link for the same can be sent to the user in email.

Once the device is allocated to the user in the XSense IdP portal, either the admin generates the OTP or an automated email with the OTP will be sent to the user's email. The device must be in corporate mode in order to use this tool.

After the devices are assigned to the users, the ThinC Manager is required for fingerprint enrolment and registering the key with the services. The ThinC Manager tool has two sub-windows i.e.,

- Enroll Fingerprints
- Account Management
