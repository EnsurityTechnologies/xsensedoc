XSense CPP is the plugin that needs to be installed on all machines where login is required. This plugin will replace windows' default credentials provider and only allow the user to login into the machine using this plugin. At the time of user login, a customized login will be displayed for the user to log in, this will allow the user to login into the machine using a registered ThinC-AUTH biometric security key.
