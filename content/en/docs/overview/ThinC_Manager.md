The **ThinC Manager Tool** is a standalone application, which helps the end-users to enroll their Fingerprints on to their assigned ThinC-AUTH biometric security key. A corporate license will be integrated within the ThinC-AUTH Keys to facilitate the AMS compatibility, which enable complete life-cycle management of FIDO2 Security Keys.

The ThinC Manager securely communicates with the AMS module of the XSense Server Portal for validating the assigned number of fingerprints to be enrolled by the designed users. 

- The Tool is required for enrolling user's fingerprints on the assigned Biometric FIDO2 Security Keys.
- User needs to securely login to the Agent Tool with one-time-pass-code that is generated by the XSense IdP Server.
- The Tool can be pushed to the end-user system through Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), or can be downloaded from the enterprise portal - a link for the same can be sent to the user in email.

Please refer to the **[ThinC Manager user guide]({{< ref "/auth/thincauth/thinc_manager" >}} "link")** for a detailed explanation of the fingerprint enrollment process.
