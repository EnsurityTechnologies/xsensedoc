Reports in XSense IdP are critical for maintaining security, compliance, and operational efficiency. They help organizations make informed decisions, track user activities, identify security threats, and ensure that their identity and access management processes are functioning as intended.

Here are types of reports that are available in XSense IdP server:

* Audit Logs
* Security Logs
* Device Logs

XSense IdP offers users the ability to export these logs for the purpose of auditing and verification.

## Audit Logs

Administrators have the opportunity to see a thorough history of the events and changes associated to the components available in XSense solution through the audit logs page. These events are systematically logged by the XSense IdP Server, giving important details about the actions executed within the solution.
These logs are crucial for tracking and investigating activities and are commonly used as a source for generating reports.
