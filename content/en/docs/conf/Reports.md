## Audit Logs

On the audit logs page, the admin can view all records of events and changes with the application. The XSense Server captures events by recording who performed an activity, what activity was performed, and how the system responded.


## Device Logs
Device logs contain the information sent by the ThinC Manager application recorded by XSense Server. The actions performed on ThinC-AUTH devices using the ThinC Manager application will be updated in the device logs section. These actions include Fingerprint enrollment, credential registration, device reset, and Set Max Fingerprints.


## Security Logs

The XSense Server stores and displays the history of events and errors in the XSense Server, XSense CPP, and ThinC Manager application. It provides information such as records of user login to the XSense dashboard, user activity, and authentication requests.
