The default administrator account for the XSense IdP server portal is the one you generally use to log in for the first time. Using the default administrative account, you can create additional directory service users one at a time, or you can perform a bulk import from the Azure AD / Local AD / LDAP based on the AD filters. The administrator can start configuring the XSense IdP portal after successfully logging in.

The following options are part of the initial configuration:

* Configuring XSense IdP to sync users from local AD or enterprise AAD.
* Set up SMTP for sending emails automatically for mailing reports.
