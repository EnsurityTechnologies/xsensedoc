This section outlines the operation of Firmware updates. Firmware updates involve the act of upgrading the software within the ThinC-AUTH biometric security key. Ensurity provides these updates to improve the performance, stability, security, and features of ThinC-AUTH biometric security keys.

After Ensurity releases a new firmware version, they provide the updated firmware file to the organization's IT team. This file must then be uploaded to the XSense IdP portal. Once the firmware is successfully uploaded, XSense IdP will distribute the firmware to all ThinC-AUTH devices via the ThinC Manager application.

## Firmware update procedure

* After the user connects the ThinC-AUTH biometric security key to ThinC Manager and logs into the application, it checks whether there is a firmware update available for the connected device.
* If an update is found, the application proceeds to download the firmware file from XSense IdP and initiates an automatic update of the device.
