The FIDO devices section provides an overview of the controls available for the FIDO-compliant devices on mobile platforms, such as smartphones and tablets, within an organization's authentication. FIDO device management is a vital component of modern mobile security strategies, enabling organizations to extend the benefits of FIDO-based authentication to mobile devices, FIDO2 security keys, etc.

FIDO device management is often associated with passwordless authentication, reducing reliance on traditional passwords and enhancing security by using biometrics or cryptographic keys for user verification.

*The feature is presently undergoing development activity.*
