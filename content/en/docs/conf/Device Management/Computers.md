During the installation of XSense CPP on a workstation or server, the application establishes a connection with the XSense IdP portal by utilizing the API configuration file. Subsequently, it generates and transmits a unique ID associated with the workstation or server to the XSense IdP portal. XSense IdP compiles a comprehensive list of all computers installed with XSense CPP for multifactor authentication under the **Computers** tab.

When an user attempts to sign in to the workstation or server with XSense CPP installed, the XSense IdP portal identifies the users membership in one of groups: the admin group, privileged users group, or regular users group, MFA local users group. Based on the group member, the system then prompts the user to provide the appropriate authentication method tailored for the group.

Several actions can be executed on a specific computer. These actions are listed below:

* Whitelist PC
* Assign Users
* Assign Group
* Delete

## Whitelist PC

A trusted computer is specifically allowed to create remote desktop connections to a particular target machine when it is whitelisted for RDP access. By restricting RDP access to approved devices, this access control solution minimises the risk of unauthorised access and possible security breaches.

**Scenario:** An administrator is attempting to establish a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection to a server machine for administrative tasks. When signing in to Windows via XSense CPP for this purpose, the administrator is required to undergo biometric authentication. This biometric authentication process occurs on the administrator's own computer, where the ThinC-AUTH device is connected. The ThinC Agent tool facilitates the transmission of the biometric authentication request to the XSense CPP on the remote server. Once the response is received by XSense CPP, the administrator is granted access to sign in to the server.

Prior to commencing the RDP session, the IP address of the administrator's machine should be added to the whitelist group in the XSense IdP server for the specific remote machine.

* To enable the user's machine to initiate an RDP connection to the remote machine, the administrator must include the IP address of the machine from which the RDP session will be initiated. click on **Whitelist PC >> New Whitelist PC**.  In the **New Whitelist PC** dialog, input the name of the remote machine and the user's IP address from where the remote connection is being initiated.
* Check the check box **Is Enabled** and click on **Save**.

* The user initiates the RDP connection to the remote machine and performs authentication of the ThinC-AUTH device as prompted by XSense CPP on the remote machine.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" context="note" text="The ThinC Agent application needs to be actively running, and the ThinC-AUTH biometric security key must be connected to the user's computer." />}}

## Assign Users

XSense IdP offers administrators the choice to link a user to a PC, granting access to a workstation or server upon verification of their AD credentials and the completion of multifactor authentication.

## Assign Group

XSense IdP offers administrators the capability to allocate a set of users access to a workstation or server while enforcing multifactor authentication.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" context="note" text="If no users or groups have been assigned to the machine, all users are automatically permitted access to the workstation or server using the designated multifactor authentication method."/>}}

## Delete

This action signifies that the computer is no longer part of the group of devices that users or groups can access. Users won't be able to access the workstation or server using XSense CPP, even if it is installed on the machine.
